    " * A model with many parameters require more data: bserve that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.\n",
